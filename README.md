- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarilizePi.
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, fantasy books, and silly things. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Web Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the ugly back end stuff that nobody wants to touch. You know, an extra challenge to fill the existential void. :)
- 📫 How to reach me: marilizepi@gmail.com
